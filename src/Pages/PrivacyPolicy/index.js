            example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take
            you away from one of our websites onto a different website. These
            other websites may send their cookies to you, independently collect
            data or solicit Protected Information and may or may not have their
            published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave
            our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third-party
            websites or applications before submitting any Protected Information
            to third parties. SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND WIDGETS Our online and
            mobile Services may include social media features, such as the
            Facebook Like button, widgets such as a “Share This” button, or
            interactive mini-programs that run on our online and mobile
            Services. These features may collect your IP address, photograph,

            may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social
            media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or
            hosted directly on our online Services. Your interactions with these

            Policy shall not cover the usage of any information about you which
            is obtained by the Pilot while providing you a ride on a bike booked
            using the Services, or otherwise. If you are a Pilot , we may share
            your name, vehicle number, driving license number, phone number,
            and/or profile picture (if applicable), and tracking details with
            our customers to provide them the Services. CHANGE OF INFORMATION
            AND CANCELLATION OF ACCOUNT You are responsible for maintaining the
            accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact
            information provided as part of account registration. If your
            Protected Information changes, or if you no longer desire our
            Services, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information
            by making the change on our member information page or by contacting
            us through through email address mentioned on our website or Mobile
            Application. We will make good faith efforts to make requested
            changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably
            practicable. You may also cancel or modify the communications that
            you have elected to receive from the Services by following the
            instructions contained within an e-mail or by logging into your user
            account and changing your communication preferences. If upon
            modifying or changing the information earlier provided to Us, we
            find it difficult to permit access to our Services to you due to
            insufficiency/ inaccuracy of the information, we may, in our sole
            discretion terminate your access to the Services by providing you a
            written notice to this effect on your registered email id. If you
            wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your
            information to provide you services, contact us through the email
            address mentioned on the trip bill received. We will retain your
            Protected Information and Usage Information (including geo-location)
            for as long as your account with the Services is active and as
            needed to provide you services. Even after your account is
            terminated, we will retain your Protected Information and Usage
            Information (including geo-location, trip history, and transaction
            history) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory
            obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to
            the cancellation of an account, investigate or prevent fraud and
            other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for
            other business reason. After some time, your data may be anonymized
            and aggregated, and then maybe held by us as long as necessary for
            us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the
            anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes. SECURITY The
            Protected Information and Usage Information we collect is securely
            stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide,
            commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption,
            firewalls, and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your
            information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no
            security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of
            our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply
            won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet
            or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the
            Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose
            your password to anyone. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY From time to
            time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our
            information practices. Any changes will be effective immediately
            upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If we make any
            material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail
            address specified in your account) or using a notice on the Services
            before the change becomes effective. We encourage you to
            periodically review this page for the latest information on our
            privacy practices.
